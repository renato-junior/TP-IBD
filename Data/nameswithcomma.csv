Save and invest steal and extort arrest and get arrested - in single-player and multiplayer modes with ranks and ladders. Unleash your inner gremlin!HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?Gremlins Inc. is designed for 2 to 6 players in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them to move around the playing field and to perform a number of different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You play for score limit or rounds or for time limit in custom or ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). Password-protected private sessions are also available.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time and single-player mode offers automatic Save/Load function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?There are different types of cards in the game (permanent regular secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are and what you have in your hand. Normally you spend half of your game time accumulating things and another half controlling other players (stealing arresting making them pay a fine initiating player conflicts and so on). The more you play the more new strategies you will discover especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a row.MAKE DECISIONS PLAN YOUR MOVESThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the layers of optional features allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play the more roads to victory you discover using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a resource system that allows for many comebacks even after youre robbed or arrested (or both). With score money votes malice income and bribes the tension remains until the very last round.In this game you have to be mean to win: not letting the others to score is as important as scoring yourself. The only true moment of unity in a multiplayer session is when everybodys united against the player whos about to win the game. Earn and steal resources set traps arrest initiate Player Conflicts bluff and climb up the political ladder to become the Governor.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league and take part in the regularly organised tournaments (normally over 1000 players participate). A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session so that you cant really disregard someone as a newbie player or target a veteran as your prime suspect in a political race.In addition to the multilayer mode the game offers 9 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different AI bots (with each major update we keep adding new challenges).FACTS & FIGURESThe game currently features 169 cards in the main deck: permanent regular secret and criminal each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration (with each major update we keep adding 1-2 new cards to the core deck).The game also features 34 telegrams of Misfortune in the Misfortune deck: send and receive events that may disrupt another players plans or significantly improve your own standing (with each major update we keep adding 1-2 new cards to the Misfortune deck).Chaos Cards: an optional set of 6 cards available to every player in the game that changes the dynamics of the session.Special Character Abilities: an optional feature that enables 12 sets of abilities unique to each character type which then defines the core strategy of every player.There are 11 locations - the Office the Plant the Dump the Marketplace the Inferno the Jail the Casino the Court the Treasure the Bank and the Astral Plane - and 7 spot types - Danger Gamble Police Income Bribe Misfortune and Tribune.The game took us three years to develop from concept to Early Access and to full release and were committed to the continued support of the community and development of new features and new content. It is the brainchild of Alexey Bokulev the acclaimed creator of Eador.Genesis. There are currently over 35000 players of Gremlins Inc. on Steam from all over the world including USA Russia China Japan UK and France. Collectively players launched over 400000 single-player and multiplayer sessions since the games full release in March 2016.FINALLY WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?You think thats just a pocket watch in your hand a watch thats a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No no and no - you couldnt be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank its own casino... and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions then its probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.More than anything in life gremlins value money political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)We felt it important to note that Gremlins Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs in every session the game offers the same deck to every player and everyones chances are equal.OUR DLC POLICYWe remain committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features (e.g. special character abilities) and new content (e.g. new cards new Misfortunes) that come in the form of regular updates that are FREE for every owner of the product. At the same time from time to time we create and release fun stuff (animations character portraits alternative music themes) that is not related to the game mechanics as paid DLCs. If you like it you can support our efforts by your purchase. However there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments.IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ONLINE CONNECTIONGremlins Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. This is not to say that we dont like single-player - we do and theres a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like. However the architecture of the game is built in a way that allows us to continually update the game mechanics and AI logic which for this reason is processed entirely on the server side. Therefore whether you play Gremlins Inc. in a single-player mode or in a multiplayer mode your game client needs to be connected to Steam and games server at all times. If you are looking specifically for a game that can be played offline then Gremlins Inc. in the current state is not the right product for you. An offline-only version of the game is currently in development for release later in 2016.AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERSThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game especially from China we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1466956422,This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money political power and prestige.

Save and invest steal and extort arrest and get arrested - in single-player and multiplayer modes with ranks and ladders. Unleash your inner gremlin!HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?Gremlins Inc. is designed for 2 to 6 players in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them to move around the playing field and to perform a number of different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You play for score limit or rounds or for time limit in custom or ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). Password-protected private sessions are also available.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time and single-player mode offers automatic Save/Load function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?There are different types of cards in the game (permanent regular secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are and what you have in your hand. Normally you spend half of your game time accumulating things and another half controlling other players (stealing arresting making them pay a fine initiating player conflicts and so on). The more you play the more new strategies you will discover especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a row.MAKE DECISIONS PLAN YOUR MOVESThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the layers of optional features allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play the more roads to victory you discover using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a resource system that allows for many comebacks even after youre robbed or arrested (or both). With score money votes malice income and bribes the tension remains until the very last round.In this game you have to be mean to win: not letting the others to score is as important as scoring yourself. The only true moment of unity in a multiplayer session is when everybodys united against the player whos about to win the game. Earn and steal resources set traps arrest initiate Player Conflicts bluff and climb up the political ladder to become the Governor.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league and take part in the regularly organised tournaments (normally over 1000 players participate). A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session so that you cant really disregard someone as a newbie player or target a veteran as your prime suspect in a political race.In addition to the multilayer mode the game offers 9 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different AI bots (with each major update we keep adding new challenges).FACTS & FIGURESThe game currently features 169 cards in the main deck: permanent regular secret and criminal each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration (with each major update we keep adding 1-2 new cards to the core deck).The game also features 34 telegrams of Misfortune in the Misfortune deck: send and receive events that may disrupt another players plans or significantly improve your own standing (with each major update we keep adding 1-2 new cards to the Misfortune deck).Chaos Cards: an optional set of 6 cards available to every player in the game that changes the dynamics of the session.Special Character Abilities: an optional feature that enables 12 sets of abilities unique to each character type which then defines the core strategy of every player.There are 11 locations - the Office the Plant the Dump the Marketplace the Inferno the Jail the Casino the Court the Treasure the Bank and the Astral Plane - and 7 spot types - Danger Gamble Police Income Bribe Misfortune and Tribune.The game took us three years to develop from concept to Early Access and to full release and were committed to the continued support of the community and development of new features and new content. It is the brainchild of Alexey Bokulev the acclaimed creator of Eador.Genesis. There are currently over 35000 players of Gremlins Inc. on Steam from all over the world including USA Russia China Japan UK and France. Collectively players launched over 400000 single-player and multiplayer sessions since the games full release in March 2016.FINALLY WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?You think thats just a pocket watch in your hand a watch thats a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No no and no - you couldnt be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank its own casino... and even its own jail!

Hes so tall he could be mistaken for a very short human! Because Axes height made him unsuitable for mining he set off to seek his fortune in the lands above. Away from familiar tunnels and dank caves Axe often gets lost on the surface world but doesnt like to admit it. When he is not busy searching for his fortune he likes skipping rocks on a stream and eating hot dogs on a stick. He thinks that they are made of real dogs and has never learned how to tie his shoelaces.Bow is regretably the shortest member of her elfin village. She left her home in shame because she was only ever tall enough to gather berries with the elfin children. Bow did not want to be a babysitter in the bushes for the rest of her life so she ran away from home when she was sixty (which is like sixteen in human years) to train as an ninja so that she could one day return home a glorious hero and bring glory to short elves everywhere. To this day she still has not found a Ninja Sensei to teach her the proper art of Nenjootsoo the elven translation of ninjutsu. This also means that she and Axe are about the same height...Staff has been called many things amongst them hypochondriac and sniffles are probably the nicer terms that people have used. As a hypo-sensitive wizard with extensive allergies he prefers to hide behind much bulkier heroes and fold origami on his days off.

Forgotten Not Lost comes from the creators of A More Beautiful World and is a kinetic novel that tackles the theme of dementia and is a visual novel that hopes to bring tears into our readers eyes especially those who have gone through similar situations when dementia or Alzheimers has claimed the memory of a loved one.,Our Media Friends!Ever since our Greenlighting weve received so much love from everyone and we are humbled!Otaku Aniverse - Forgotten Not Lost has two of the most important qualities needed to make a visual novel great. The most important part of any visual novel is a strong and thought provoking story that draws out emotions in the reader. This visual novel has a solid story that conveys an important message and puts you in the shoes of the main character. Another important feature that should be present in any visual novel is art that compliments the story and emotions. The art in this visual novel is simple but helps to set the mood as it was intended. I highly recommend this to visual novel fans who enjoy emotional stories and simple yet beautiful art.SUBALTERN GAMING - Forgotten Not Lost is a great accomplishment for effectively instilling varying emotions into the writing and overall package of the game and successfully conveying this to the player. While the topic of dementia is sad in itself it is handled well here and not overly pandering. The author of the story Darren Kwok based it off actual experiences caring for someone with dementia. Afterthought Studios in concert with the motto of Touching Hearts Through Words created this short kinetic novel. It is a mature title backed by a mature-in professionalism at least-company. Its short and inexpensive and a great example of an indie title matching big-budget talent.Fuwanovel - It does what few VNs manage to do by tackling a serious health and psychological issue in a very real and relatable way.Hayurika - ... the story does leave the player with a deep feeling for the farmer and his illness hopefully helping raise more awareness about dementia and Alzheimers in the long run.VNVortex - The art of the game is quite simplistic but it fits the sorrowful theme very nicely - same can also be said for the music which complements the whole package neatly.Merus Reviews - The music (which I liked a lot) character sprites and backgrounds are quite simple and subdued but fittingly so given the themes and setting and they work together with the words to evoke a bittersweet atmosphere that veers between joyful and gloomy along with the protagonists changing moods.About the GameAn old farmer lives with his wife - However he hasnt quite been himself lately.

Whether you end up with boats that are slow fast turn well chine walk or tend to blow over at high speeds or not depends on what you do with the shape and design of the hull.Boat Design Variables:There are more than 25 adjustable parameters in the simulator you can play with that affect not only the boats appearance but also the performance and handling.  Some of these include:Single twin and triple engine outboard installations (up to 900 total horsepower with triples)Engine power (150 hp through 300 hp in 25 hp increments guided by or using real outboard engine dyno data)Propeller pitchOverall hull length width and molded depthTransom heightChine widthBow and transom deadrise anglesCockpit position width and dash heightSeat positions  and floor depth (the drivers position matters a great deal for balance)Bow top shapeOverall hull curvaturePad or no pad:  With a pad you can choose the pad deadrise (side) angle length width and height.Strakes/Step positions width and deadrise (side) angle.  You can run two steps or no steps.Jackplate setback (from 4 to 12 inches)Weight can be adjusted from 0% (lightest) to 100% (double the lightest weight) in 10% increments.This is not your typical boat game its a serious hardcore physics simulator used by real life boat racers including Formula 1 2 3 and offshore powerboat racers to keep their skills sharp between races.The boat mesh is generated procedurally (mathematically) from the above parameters.  The physics computations are run directly on those mesh triangles for your design.   All parameters affect the handling and top speed of the boat in much the same way they do on a real boat.The physics code/vehicle simulation model driving all this is a proprietary system that solves thousands of hydrodynamic skin friction buoyancy and aerodynamic forces separately on almost every triangle in the boat mesh lower unit and powerhead as well as the individual propeller blades. Chine walk naturally comes out of the model as well as blowover.   A lot can be learned about both by experimenting with the hull design and driving techniques inside the boat sim.   You can learn to control chine walk in a real boat by practicing it safely in the simulator first.Skin friction at the hull and lower unit is computed using a sophisticated Reynolds number approach that depends on the details of the water/hull interaction so as you trim the engine or adjust the hull or pad design to raise the bow or hull out of the water with aerodynamic lift the effect on top speed is similar to what you would get with a real boat.  The same goes for the cockpit operated hydraulic jackplate which can be used to raise the entire engine up to minimize wetted drag on the lower unit to attain even higher speeds.Paddlewheel effects due to surface piercing propellers come out of the physics model due to the individual propeller blade modelling so when the jack plate is raised or the engine trim is adjusted to lift the propeller partly out of the water (surface piercing prop) in the hunt for maximum speed the lopsided propeller forces from blades exposed to the air tend to steer the boat which requires a steering correction similar to real life surfacing propellers.MapsThese maps are real life locations generated from satellite terrain data.Lotus Lake in Chanhassen Minnesota is a small three bay lake about one mile long that the developer grew up on and spent untold hours driving the family speedboat on.Glen Canyon Utah is an enormous stretch of the San Juan river that takes more than 30 minutes to drive the entire length of in a 100 mph+ boat.  It includes a bit of everything in one giant map.  Theres a narrow twisty section of the river some wider straighter areas and a couple of wide open lake areas that are each much larger than Lotus Lake.  With multiple starting locations its like several maps in one.Are there more real life locations youd like to see added to the simulator?   Post them here!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/501090/discussions/0/353915309341981755/Simulation modes Free as the Wind mode lets you drive freely in much the same way youd play with a flight simulator.  Go anywhere and do anything you want without any buoy turn markers or timers or goals.  In this mode there are multiple starting locations spread throughout each map.   Courses mode lets you drive competitively either in lapped solo time trials or in one mile top speed shootouts (available on both maps) with your results submitted to a separate leaderboard for each course.  NEW August 6 2016: Leaderboards are available for all courses.   Previously they were available for top speed shootouts only.CoursesCourses are open water circuits on the Lotus Lake and Glen Canyon maps marked by buoys the same way its done in real powerboat racing (red buoys are for right turns yellow buoys are for left).   As of August 4 2016 all non-top speed shooutout courses have leaderboard functionality added that will display your rank best ever laptime last laptime best session laptime and world record laptime every time a lap is completed.    Lotus Lake Top Speed Shootout:  A straight mile long course for top speed competition. Lotus Lake Short:  A short four turn lapping course in the main bay similar to some formula style boat circuits.  Laptimes here are usually less than one minute.  Lotus Lake Full Lap:  A longer course with a large number of turns that hugs the shoreline and takes you around the entire lake once per lap.  A full trip in a quick boat that turns well takes under three minutes. Glen Canyon Shootout:  A straight mile long course for top speed competition. Glen Canyon Full: This enormous one-way point to point course extends the entire length of the Glen Canyon map and is well over 40 miles in length.  It can take more than 30 minutes to go from one end to the other with a boat capable of 100 mph.   Glen Canyon Minnow:  A short four turn lapping course with two very tight left handers a medium right turn and a long 180 left hander.  Similar to formula style tracks with lap times typically around 50-55 seconds or less. Glen Canyon Steak:  A large offshore powerboat style course held in a large bay thats partly out in the open water but also snakes between the shoreline and a couple of small islands.  The turns are long and wide here for the most part very high speed.  Lap times under three minutes.Do you have course layout ideas for the existing maps or real world map locations youd like to see added?  Suggest them here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/501090/discussions/0/353915309341981755/Youre not restricted to driving on courses however.  Just choose Free as the Wind mode and go anywhere you want.

Some of these include:Single twin and triple engine outboard installations (up to 900 total horsepower with triples)Engine power (150 hp through 300 hp in 25 hp increments guided by or using real outboard engine dyno data)Propeller pitchOverall hull length width and molded depthTransom heightChine widthBow and transom deadrise anglesCockpit position width and dash heightSeat positions  and floor depth (the drivers position matters a great deal for balance)Bow top shapeOverall hull curvaturePad or no pad:  With a pad you can choose the pad deadrise (side) angle length width and height.Strakes/Step positions width and deadrise (side) angle.  You can run two steps or no steps.Jackplate setback (from 4 to 12 inches)Weight can be adjusted from 0% (lightest) to 100% (double the lightest weight) in 10% increments.This is not your typical boat game its a serious hardcore physics simulator used by real life boat racers including Formula 1 2 3 and offshore powerboat racers to keep their skills sharp between races.The boat mesh is generated procedurally (mathematically) from the above parameters.  The physics computations are run directly on those mesh triangles for your design.   All parameters affect the handling and top speed of the boat in much the same way they do on a real boat.The physics code/vehicle simulation model driving all this is a proprietary system that solves thousands of hydrodynamic skin friction buoyancy and aerodynamic forces separately on almost every triangle in the boat mesh lower unit and powerhead as well as the individual propeller blades. Chine walk naturally comes out of the model as well as blowover.   A lot can be learned about both by experimenting with the hull design and driving techniques inside the boat sim.   You can learn to control chine walk in a real boat by practicing it safely in the simulator first.Skin friction at the hull and lower unit is computed using a sophisticated Reynolds number approach that depends on the details of the water/hull interaction so as you trim the engine or adjust the hull or pad design to raise the bow or hull out of the water with aerodynamic lift the effect on top speed is similar to what you would get with a real boat.  The same goes for the cockpit operated hydraulic jackplate which can be used to raise the entire engine up to minimize wetted drag on the lower unit to attain even higher speeds.Paddlewheel effects due to surface piercing propellers come out of the physics model due to the individual propeller blade modelling so when the jack plate is raised or the engine trim is adjusted to lift the propeller partly out of the water (surface piercing prop) in the hunt for maximum speed the lopsided propeller forces from blades exposed to the air tend to steer the boat which requires a steering correction similar to real life surfacing propellers.MapsThese maps are real life locations generated from satellite terrain data.Lotus Lake in Chanhassen Minnesota is a small three bay lake about one mile long that the developer grew up on and spent untold hours driving the family speedboat on.Glen Canyon Utah is an enormous stretch of the San Juan river that takes more than 30 minutes to drive the entire length of in a 100 mph+ boat.  It includes a bit of everything in one giant map.  Theres a narrow twisty section of the river some wider straighter areas and a couple of wide open lake areas that are each much larger than Lotus Lake.  With multiple starting locations its like several maps in one.Are there more real life locations youd like to see added to the simulator?   Post them here!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/501090/discussions/0/353915309341981755/Simulation modes Free as the Wind mode lets you drive freely in much the same way youd play with a flight simulator.  Go anywhere and do anything you want without any buoy turn markers or timers or goals.  In this mode there are multiple starting locations spread throughout each map.   Courses mode lets you drive competitively either in lapped solo time trials or in one mile top speed shootouts (available on both maps) with your results submitted to a separate leaderboard for each course.  NEW August 6 2016: Leaderboards are available for all courses.   Previously they were available for top speed shootouts only.CoursesCourses are open water circuits on the Lotus Lake and Glen Canyon maps marked by buoys the same way its done in real powerboat racing (red buoys are for right turns yellow buoys are for left).   As of August 4 2016 all non-top speed shooutout courses have leaderboard functionality added that will display your rank best ever laptime last laptime best session laptime and world record laptime every time a lap is completed.    Lotus Lake Top Speed Shootout:  A straight mile long course for top speed competition. Lotus Lake Short:  A short four turn lapping course in the main bay similar to some formula style boat circuits.  Laptimes here are usually less than one minute.  Lotus Lake Full Lap:  A longer course with a large number of turns that hugs the shoreline and takes you around the entire lake once per lap.  A full trip in a quick boat that turns well takes under three minutes. Glen Canyon Shootout:  A straight mile long course for top speed competition. Glen Canyon Full: This enormous one-way point to point course extends the entire length of the Glen Canyon map and is well over 40 miles in length.  It can take more than 30 minutes to go from one end to the other with a boat capable of 100 mph.   Glen Canyon Minnow:  A short four turn lapping course with two very tight left handers a medium right turn and a long 180 left hander.  Similar to formula style tracks with lap times typically around 50-55 seconds or less. Glen Canyon Steak:  A large offshore powerboat style course held in a large bay thats partly out in the open water but also snakes between the shoreline and a couple of small islands.  The turns are long and wide here for the most part very high speed.  Lap times under three minutes.Do you have course layout ideas for the existing maps or real world map locations youd like to see added?  Suggest them here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/501090/discussions/0/353915309341981755/Youre not restricted to driving on courses however.  Just choose Free as the Wind mode and go anywhere you want.  A lazy drive down Glen Canyon with no pressure can be surprisingly relaxing especially in VR.Controller supportFully configurable with axes/buttons.  Use a keyboard gamepad buttons/axes joystick steering wheel (force feedback supported) a combination of all of these etc..  Anything that DirectInput can see should work for a controller.Steam Controller does not have full native support but can be made to work with some effort.  See tutorial: http://steamcommunity.com/app/501090/discussions/0/352788917757551618/VR handheld controllers are NOT supported.  In VR mode you use a mouse and keyboard to navigate the user interface change cameras etc..The best setup is a force feedback steering wheel + pedals with a mouse and keyboard within reach.VR supportOculus Rift DK1 DK2 and CV1 : Fully supported.  Requires Oculus Home 1.3 or higher.Vive:  NOT YET supported but will come.Oculus VR headsets are optional.  Single dual and triple monitor setups are supported.Developer infoThis solo indie project is under continuing development by Todd Wasson formerly the physics engine programmer/vehicle dynamics engineer behind Virtual RC Racing and its successor VRC Pro.   Todd has been writing physics engines and vehicle models since before 2000 and specializes in vehicle dynamics.Audio was created by Greg Hill of Soundwave Concepts the master car (and now boat) engine audio developer behind iRacing and many other sim racing titles.Future developmentProvided theres enough support from the community this products development will continue after Steam release with an aim first on providing more types of boats and fixing any issues that arise.
